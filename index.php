        <p>
            This is a little project I made to see how a fake currency would develop. It's really only an API to transfer a currency between accounts. But I really wanted to see what happens when you make a currency API that anybody can use. Get started by <a href="/register.php">registering</a> and <a href="/documentation.php">reading the documentation</a>.

            This is not a cryptocurrency. I hate cryptocurrencies.
